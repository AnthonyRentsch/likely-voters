# Scripts

`load.R` - Read in, clean, and pool data from CCES. Read in Catalist data.

`raw-vote-intent.R` - Script where I look at how self-reported voting intentions changed among different racial groups between 2012 and 2016.

`national_models.Rmd` - Markdown file where I create/define likely voter models and evaluate their performance on an individual level and use them to make election predictions at the national level. View the output [here](https://github.com/AnthonyRentsch/thesis_LikelyVoters/blob/master/national_models.md).

`state_models.Rmd` - Similar to `national_models.Rmd` but goes state by state. View the output [here](https://github.com/AnthonyRentsch/thesis_LikelyVoters/blob/master/state_models.md).

`summary_graphics.R` - Script where I create four summary graphics for results/discussion section. Two compare results to all my modeling approaches and two act as mock-ups for how journalists or pollsters could use my work when reporting on polls.

`analysis_test.Rmd` - Test markdown file for cutoff likely voter models. This file only uses 2016 data throughout and is meant to be a draft of my analysis.
